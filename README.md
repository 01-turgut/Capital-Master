## Tecnologies

### Languages
- HTML
- CSS3
- JavaScript

### Frameworks And Libraries
- [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was used to create the mock ups.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframes.
- [Bootstrap 5.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to contribute to responsiveness and styling of the site.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for button icons.
- Git was used for version control ad to push code to GitHub.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to store the repository and deploy the project.
- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as the IDE to code the project.


## Testing

The testing process can be viewed [here](testing.md).

## Deployment

The following steps were followed to deploy the project to a live website in GitHub, using Github Pages:

- Ensure changes have been added and commited in Gitpod and pushed to GitHub.
- Login to GitHub.
- Locate the relevant repository on GitHub. This is the repository for [Capital Master](https://github.com/01-turgut/Capital-Master).
- At the top of the repository, locate the 'Settings' link and click on this.
- On the left of the page, under Options, scroll down until you get to Pages and click on Pages.
- Under Source, in the first box called "None", click the dropdown and select "master".
- Then select Save.
- The page will refresh and you will see a link above the Save button. This is the link to the live site. Note that it may take a few minutes for the site to be deployed.
- There are no differences between the deployed version and the development version of this project.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
The repository can be forked on GitHub, this creates a copy of the repository that can be viewed or amended without affecting the original repository. This can be done using the following steps:

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- At the top right of the repository (under your avatar) locate the Fork button and click this button.
- There should now be a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can amend.

### Cloning the GitHub Repository
A clone of the repository can be made, which will create a local copy on your own computer. Changes can be made to this local copy and it will not affect the original repository. Follow these steps to clone the Sunrise Yoga repository.

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- Click the button called "Code".
- Under HTTPS copy the link provided, in this case (https://github.com/01-turgut/Capital-Master.git).
- Go to Gitpod or whichever IDE you are using and open the Terminal.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type 'git clone' followed by the url you copied in step 3.
- Press "Enter" to create the local clone.
- You can refer to the GitHub documentation for more detailed information on the above process [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
